# GoLang
Repository to add projects and practice questions as I learn Go lang. 

I took up the "Programming with Google Go Specialization" on CourseEra in order to learn GoLang. Having come from an extensive experience with C , it was truly useful for me. 

I am adding all the assignments that I did on the course for future reference.
